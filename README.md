> The most convenient time zone converter on planet Earth.

## Inspiration

Since our team consists of international students in Taiwan taking online classes, timezone conversions for classes or meetings are inevitable. However, we realized that there isn't a straightforward, user-friendly method to easily convert time. Plus, adding the converted time to an online calendar is an extra step for the user, so we incorporated that into our project.

## Features

AnyTime is a simple and easy-to-use time converter Chrome extension that allow user to easily convert time and seamlessly add to their calendar.

Convert. AnyTime.

-   Saves your time zones
