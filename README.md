## Inspiration

AnyTime was created during 2020 Sunhacks Hackathon. 

Since our hackathon team consists of international students in Taiwan taking online classes, time zone conversions for classes or meetings are inevitable. However, we realized that there isn't a straightforward, user-friendly method to easily convert time. Plus, adding the converted time to an online calendar is an extra step for the user, so we incorporated that into our project.

## What's next for AnyTime
- Conduct usability testing to refine the extension
- Add more functionalities (fact sheet, share converted times, etc.)
